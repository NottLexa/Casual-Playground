    "Welcome to localization.json, fellow translators! This file is used to localize Casual Playground's strings",

    "dictionary, called locstring.",

    "Each locstring has several keys:",
    "1) key '__usage' (set by developer) that describes where this locstring is used in the game;",
    "2) key '__noloc' that is a standard version of string if it wasn't (yet) localized into player's preferred",
    "language; '__noloc' is an english version of string by default.",
    "3) other keys are being 3-letter code of language this string is being localized to (see ISO 639-2).",
    "For example: 'rus' is Russian variant of string, 'deu' is German, 'fra' is French, 'fin' is Finnish and so on.",
    "English doesn't need translation because '__noloc' is already an english variant of string.",

    "Translation is mainly made by community, because developer doesn't know any language except Russian and English.",
